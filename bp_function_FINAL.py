ðŸŽ¨ Blue Picasso ðŸŽ¨

I designed this program as a way to visualize Picasso's famous 'Blue Period'
by taking yearly averages of the Red, Green, and Blue values in the pixels of 
his paintings, and plot them over time. As I was working, I had the idea of 
combining the yearly average RGB values as a single color, and then placing
those colors in a spectrum to show change over time. 

The result is a function that can turn any properly named set of images 
('y + year of composition + .jpg') into a color spectrum and a series of plots
showing change over time. 

color_spec() takes 2 arguments, start_date (the beginning of the artists career/
year of oldest image) and end_date (the artist's final work/year of newest image).

It then cycles through every year in between the start and end date, loading the
collective RGB averages into 3 2D arrays (allred,allgreen,allblue), which are later 
combined into a 3D RGB Image array. 

This image is printed in the console (along with plots of allred, allgreen, and allblue)
and saved in the working directory as 'bpspectrum.jpg'

Hope you enjoy using it!
